        <h1>Escape Hatch Festival</h1>
        <p>Friday 28th - Sunday 30th June 2024</p>
        <p>We invite you to join us for an intimate electronic music festival held over three days in a stunning location near Glastonbury, UK.</p>
        <p>After keeping listeners entertained worldwide during lockdown and the years beyond, resident DJs from internet radio station <a href="http://www.thehatch.tech">www.thehatch.tech</a> will unite to bring you the finest beats on a bespoke, crystal-clear sound system!</p>
        <p>This event will include onsite camping for tents or camper vans and there will even be a limited number of bell tents available to hire for that little bit of luxury.</p>
        <p>Also on this beautiful site spanning 20 acres of land, there is a natural spring, solar powered showers and stunning views of Glastonbury Tor and the surrounding Somerset Levels. We will also have a well-kept central fire burning throughout the weekend, giving everyone a chance to chill out and connect with others.</p>
        <p>Although Saturday will be the main day for music, we encourage everyone to arrive on the Friday to set up camp, get acquainted with everyone and enjoy this wonderful location. There will be a programme of guest DJs on the Friday evening and then the Hatch residents will take the controls for the main event on Saturday. Although the music policy will predominantly be electronic dance music (House, Techno, Breaks), on the Sunday there will also be a fine selection of Dub, Chill out and Downtempo beats.</p>
        <p>We are deliberately keeping this to a relatively small gathering, so we are going to set up the marquee with the sound system, the central fire and the camping area in the same field. This will really help to maintain that nice, intimate atmosphere. That said, it is a truly beautiful location and if you haven’t been before, we encourage you to explore the full 20 acre site over the weekend.</p>
        <p>This event is not for profit, so we are asking everyone attending to contribute just £40 per adult for the entire weekend to cover the running costs. Of course, this £40 will also include camping for the weekend and there are no extra charges for those bringing camper vans or caravans. Even the DJs, artists, and the event organizers will be making the same contribution to keep the costs down for everyone attending.</p>
        <p>Just follow the payment link below to make your contribution:</p>

        <p>This is a private event so it will not be advertised publicly, but this invite is open to any friends of The Hatch and those already attending the weekend. If you haven’t already provided your email address, please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:thehatch.tech@gmail.com">thehatch.tech@gmail.com</a> so we can send you any important updates and directions to the venue. We will also be happy to answer any queries you may have, so just drop us a line.</p>
        <p>We look forward to seeing you for this very special event!</p>
